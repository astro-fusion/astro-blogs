The 4th House in Vedic astrology represents one's home, mother, emotional base, and property. It is inherently connected with the comfort and security felt in the emotional and physical realms. Known as "Sukha Bhava," it is considered to help astrologers predict matters related to one's residence, conveyances, the nature of familial relationships, and inherited properties. The ruling sign of the 4th House is Cancer, and its natural planetary ruler is the Moon, both of which highlight the significance of emotions and nurturance.
