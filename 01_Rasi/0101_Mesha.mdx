## Introduction to Mesha Rashi

**Mesha Rashi**, known as Aries in Western astrology, stands as the pioneering first sign of the [Vedic zodiac system](https://www.astroved.com/vedic-astrology/). As a cardinal fire sign ruled by **Mars (Mangal)**, it embodies the raw energy of new beginnings, symbolized by the determined Ram. 

Unlike Western astrology's solar calendar approach (March 21 - April 19), [Vedic astrology](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/vedic-astrology-science-of-light) employs the sidereal zodiac based on actual star positions and lunar mansions (nakshatras), making the dates variable and more astronomically accurate.
