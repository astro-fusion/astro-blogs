## Calculation and Analysis Methods {#calculation}

### Step-by-Step Calculation Process

**Required Information**:
- Your full birth name (as on your birth certificate), including all middle names[2][4][5].
- An understanding of vowels in your name: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y (when it functions as a vowel).

**Calculation Formula**:

1. **Identify all vowels** in your full birth name.
2. **Assign numerology values** (Pythagorean system: A=1, E=5, I=9, O=6, U=3, Y=7 when it acts as a vowel)[5][6][8].
3. **Add values for each name separately** (first, middle, last) and reduce each sum to a single digit or master number (11, 22, 33)[4][5].
4. **Sum the reduced digits** from each name part and reduce further if needed, unless you get a master number.

**Example**:
- Name: "Emily Ann Stone"
- Vowels: E, I, A, A, O, E
- E (5), I (9), A (1), A (1), O (6), E (5)
- Add: 5+9+1+1+6+5 = 27 ⇒ 2+7=9
- Soul Urge/Heart Desire Number = 9[1][2][5]

## Practical Vastu Applications {#practical-applications}

- Identify the best room or zone in your house for reflection or creativity according to your Soul Urge Number.
- Align main entryways or personal workspaces in directions that harmonize with your number.
- Select colors and decorative items that resonate with your number’s vibration (e.g., blue for 2, yellow for 3).
- Place crystals or plants in rooms to boost your Soul Urge energy flow, creating a nurturing and supportive space.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

- Using a nickname or married name instead of your original birth name for calculation[6][8].
- Forgetting to include all middle names or initials.
- Not reducing sums to a single digit (unless a master number appears).
- Ignoring the dual vowel/consonant role of the letter Y—which must be evaluated for each syllable[8].
- Overlooking the importance of vowels in every part of the name (first, middle, last).
