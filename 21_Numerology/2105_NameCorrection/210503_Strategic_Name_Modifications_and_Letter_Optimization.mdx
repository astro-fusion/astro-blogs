## Calculation and Analysis Methods {#calculation}

### Step-by-Step Calculation Process

**Required Information:**
- **Current Name (Spelling and Pronunciation)**
- **Date, Time, and Place of Birth (for astrological analysis)**
- **Specific Areas of Concern or Improvement Goals**

**Calculation Formula:**

1. **Name-to-Number Conversion:**  
   Assign each letter of the name a numerical value based on a standard numerology chart (e.g., A=1, B=2, ... I=9, J=1, etc.).
2. **Sum Calculation:**  
   Add the numbers of all letters in the name to get a total value.
3. **Planetary Alignment Check:**  
   Cross-reference the total value with corresponding planetary influences in Vedic astrology.
4. **Vastu Zone Mapping:**  
   Identify the Vastu zone(s) that resonate with the name’s vibration and planetary associations.

**Example:**

If “RAJESH” is the name:

- **R = 2, A = 1, J = 1, E = 5, S = 3, H = 8**
- **Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 20 → 2 + 0 = 2**
- **Interpretation:** The vibration number 2 is associated with the Moon in Vedic numerology, influencing emotional balance and intuition.

  Name changes should be personalized, not copied from others, as each individual’s astrological profile is unique.
