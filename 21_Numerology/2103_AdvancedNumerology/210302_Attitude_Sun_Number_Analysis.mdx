Sometimes referred to as the Sun Number or Attitude Number, this principle reveals how you respond to new situations, handle challenges, and project your energy in daily interactions[1][6].

- **Spiritual dimensions**: This number reflects your vibration in the cosmic order, shaping how you interact with people and spaces.

### Historical Context

The concept of using numbers to analyze personality and fate has roots in both classical Vedic texts and modern numerology. The Attitude Sun Number system was modernized by numerologists like Hans Decoz, blending ancient wisdom with contemporary methods to offer practical insights for personal and environmental harmony[1][3].

### Principle 2: Sun Number Harmony
**Description**: Achieving balance between your natural attitude and your surroundings can reduce friction and promote productive growth[6][7].

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Calculate your Sun Number using your birth chart
2. Map its qualities to specific Vastu zones (e.g., southeast for creativity, northeast for wisdom)
3. Apply supportive Vastu remedies such as specific colors, plants, or elements

## Calculation and Analysis Methods {#calculation}

### Step-by-Step Calculation Process

**Required Information**:
- Your birth month (as a number)
- Your birth day

**Calculation Formula**:

1. Add your birth month and birth day numbers together.
2. Reduce the result to a single digit by repeatedly adding its digits.
   - Example: Born on November 28 ⇒ 11 (month) + 28 (day) = 39 → 3 + 9 = 12 → 1 + 2 = 3  
   - Thus, Attitude Sun Number = 3[1][2][4][8]

**Interpretation**:
- **1**: Leadership, decisiveness, independence
- **2**: Harmony, empathy, cooperation
- **3**: Creativity, optimism, sociability
- **4**: Practicality, diligence, stability
- **5**: Versatility, adaptability, adventure
- **6**: Responsibility, nurturing, balance
- **7**: Introspection, wisdom, analysis
- **8**: Ambition, power, organization
- **9**: Compassion, idealism, humanitarianism

Once calculated, you can analyze how this number shapes your attitude, energy, and first impressions[1][2][4].

## Practical Vastu Applications {#practical-applications}

- Align your main entrance or workspace with your Attitude Sun Number’s elemental direction for better personal synergy.
- Use colors, symbols, or crystals in the relevant sectors of your home to support your number’s energy.
- Schedule major life or home changes during cycles that harmonize with your Sun Number’s vibration.

*Example*: A Number 4 native (steady, practical) should bolster the west or northwest with grounding elements and organized layouts to foster focus and stability[3][5].

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

- **Incorrect calculation**: Failing to reduce the sum to a single digit or confusing birth year with required inputs.
- **Overlooking context**: Ignoring other core numbers (Life Path, Destiny) that also influence your chart.
- **Vastu misalignment**: Applying generic Vastu tips instead of tailoring changes to your Attitude Sun Number.
- **Neglecting regular review**: Not updating your space or practices as your personal cycles evolve.
