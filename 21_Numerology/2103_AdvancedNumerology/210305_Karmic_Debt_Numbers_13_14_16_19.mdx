- Full name at birth (for Destiny, Soul Urge, and Personality numbers)
- Residential address (for Vastu applications)

**Calculation Formula**:
1. **Life Path Number**: Add all digits of your full birth date until you get a double digit. If the sum is 13, 14, 16, or 19 before reducing to a single digit, you have a Karmic Debt Number[6].
2. **Name Numbers**: Assign numbers to each letter (using Pythagorean or Chaldean system) and total them. Break down the sum; if 13, 14, 16, or 19 appear, these are Karmic Debt Numbers[2].
3. **Address Numbers**: If your house or office number is 13, 14, 16, or 19 (or their sum), the location carries karmic lessons[2][4].

## Practical Vastu Applications {#practical-applications}

- **Color and Decor**: Use Vastu-recommended hues to balance karmic energies—such as earth tones for grounding (13), and calming blues for emotional healing (16).
- **Symbolic Remedies**: Place symbols or yantras representing transformation and balance in affected areas.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

- Ignoring the presence of Karmic Debt Numbers in your chart, thinking challenges are only circumstantial.
- Attempting to "escape" the hard lessons rather than embracing the growth and responsibility they require.
- Overusing physical Vastu remedies without genuine inner work, such as disciplined self-improvement and emotional healing.
