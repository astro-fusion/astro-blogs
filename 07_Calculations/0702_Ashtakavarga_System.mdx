## Summary of Article

## Introduction
In the vast ocean of **Vedic Astrology**, prediction often relies on complex interactions between planets, signs, and houses. However, there is one system that simplifies this complexity into a clear, numerical score: **Ashtakavarga**.

**Ashtakavarga** (Eight-fold Division) is a method of evaluating the strength of planets and houses based on their positions relative to each other. Unlike other systems that rely heavily on interpretation, Ashtakavarga provides a definitive "score" for each sign in your chart. These scores, known as **Bindus** (points), reveal which areas of life are naturally supported and which require more effort.

Whether you are analyzing a birth chart or predicting the impact of a planetary transit, Ashtakavarga offers a precise tool to gauge the outcome.

## Main Content

### What is Ashtakavarga?
The term **Ashtakavarga** comes from Sanskrit: *Ashta* (Eight) and *Varga* (Division). It refers to the eight reference points used to calculate strength:
1.  Sun
2.  Moon
3.  Mars
4.  Mercury
5.  Jupiter
6.  Venus
7.  Saturn
8.  Ascendant (Lagna)

(Note: Rahu and Ketu are generally excluded from standard Ashtakavarga calculations).

In this system, each planet contributes "points" (Bindus) to the signs based on its position from itself and the other seven reference points. The total points accumulated in each sign determine its strength.

### Key Concepts: Bhinnashtakavarga vs. Sarvashtakavarga

#### 1. Bhinnashtakavarga (Individual Scores)
**Bhinnashtakavarga** (BAV) refers to the individual point distribution for each planet.
*   Every planet (Sun through Saturn) has its own BAV chart.
*   In a BAV chart, a sign can have a maximum of **8 points** (though usually less, as the planet itself contributes to specific places).
*   **Usage:** This is used to judge the strength of a specific planet during its transit.
    *   **Example:** If Saturn transits a sign where it has 5 or more points in its Bhinnashtakavarga, the transit is likely to be favorable or manageable. If it transits a sign with 0-3 points, the transit may be challenging.

#### 2. Sarvashtakavarga (Total Scores)
**Sarvashtakavarga** (SAV) is the summation of all seven Bhinnashtakavarga charts.
*   It represents the total strength of each house/sign in the horoscope.
*   The maximum possible score for a sign is **56** (though extremely rare). The total points across all 12 signs equal **337**.
*   **Average Score:** A score of **28** is considered average.
    *   **> 28 Points:** The house is strong. Matters related to this house will flourish with less effort.
    *   **\&lt; 28 Points:** The house is weak. Matters related to this house may face obstacles or require more hard work.

### How to Interpret Ashtakavarga Scores

#### Analyzing Houses (Bhavas)
The Sarvashtakavarga points in each house reveal the potential of that area of life:
*   **1st House (Self):** High points (>30) indicate strong vitality, fame, and a charismatic personality.
*   **2nd House (Wealth):** High points suggest good accumulation of wealth and family support.
*   **10th House (Career):** High points indicate professional success and high status.
*   **11th House (Gains):** Ideally, the 11th house should have more points than the 10th (gains > effort) and the 12th (gains > loss).
*   **12th House (Loss):** Lower points are generally preferred here to minimize expenses and losses, although high points can indicate foreign settlement or spiritual growth.

#### Analyzing Transits (Gochara)
Ashtakavarga is the "King of Transits." It is the most reliable way to judge the daily, monthly, or yearly impact of moving planets.
*   **The Golden Rule:** A planet transiting a sign with **high Sarvashtakavarga points (30+)** will generally give good results, even if it is a malefic planet.
*   **The Danger Zone:** A planet transiting a sign with **very low points (\&lt;20)** can trigger significant challenges, health issues, or losses.
*   **Sade Sati:** The impact of Saturn's Sade Sati is heavily modified by Ashtakavarga. If Saturn transits signs with high points (e.g., 30+), the Sade Sati may actually be a period of growth and achievement.

### Special Applications of Ashtakavarga

#### 1. Kakshya (Orbital Divisions)
Each sign of 30 degrees is divided into 8 parts (Kakshyas) of 3°45' each. Each Kakshya is ruled by a planet. This allows for pinpoint timing of events down to the day or week.

#### 2. Shodya Pinda
After reducing the Ashtakavarga points (using Trikona and Ekadhipatya Shodhana), a final strength value called **Shodya Pinda** is calculated. This is used for specific timing of events related to the planet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is a "good" Ashtakavarga score?
Generally, **28** is the benchmark.
*   **28-30:** Good/Average.
*   **30-35:** Very Strong.
*   **35+:** Excellent/Raja Yoga potential.
*   **20-25:** Weak/Struggling.
*   **Below 20:** Very Weak (requires remedies).

### 2. Can Ashtakavarga override a bad Dasha?
It can mitigate it. If you are running a difficult Dasha but the Dasha lord is transiting a sign with high points, the negative effects will be lessened. Conversely, a good Dasha lord transiting a low-point sign may not deliver full results.

### 3. Why is the 11th house score important?
The 11th house represents gains and fulfillment of desires. In Ashtakavarga, it is considered auspicious if the 11th house has more points than the 10th (gains exceeding effort) and the 12th (income exceeding expenditure).

### 4. How do I calculate my Ashtakavarga?
Manual calculation is tedious as it involves checking the position of 7 planets relative to 8 reference points for all 12 signs. It is best to use reliable astrology software or our [online tools](/kundali/reports).

## Conclusion
The **Ashtakavarga System** is a powerful, objective tool in Vedic Astrology. It cuts through the ambiguity of conflicting planetary aspects and provides a clear "strength map" of your life.

Use Ashtakavarga to plan your career moves, financial investments, and major life decisions with confidence.
