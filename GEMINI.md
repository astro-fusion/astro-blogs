## Output File Requirements

### 1. Filename Convention
-   The filename must be URL-friendly (a "slug").
-   **Format:** `{unique_id}_{slugified_title}.mdx`
-   **Example:** For a topic "Identifying Vastu Doshas" with ID `180901`, the filename should be `180901_identifying_vastu_doshas.mdx`.

### 2. File Content Structure
The generated `.mdx` file must contain the following sections in this exact order:

#### a. YAML Frontmatter
Create a YAML block (`---`) with the following keys:
-   **`title`**: A compelling, SEO-friendly title for the article.
-   **`description`**: A concise, meta-description-friendly summary (150-160 characters) of the article's content.
-   **`keywords`**: A comma-separated list of relevant primary and secondary keywords.
-   **`summary`**: A slightly longer summary (2-3 sentences) used for article previews.

#### b. Article Body
-   **Content Quality:** The content must be extremely detailed, with "minute details" as requested. Demonstrate deep analysis and critical thinking. The target length should be substantial, around 400 lines, to ensure comprehensive coverage.
-   **Introduction (`# Introduction...`)**: Start with a captivating introduction that defines the topic and explains its importance to the reader.
-   **Subheadings (`## Subheading...`)**: Use descriptive H2 subheadings to break the main topic into logical, easy-to-digest sections.
-   **Detailed Paragraphs**: Under each subheading, provide in-depth explanations, practical examples, and actionable insights.
-   **FAQ Section (`## FAQ`)**: Include a dedicated FAQ section with 3-4 relevant questions and their clear, concise answers.
-   **Conclusion (`## Conclusion`)**: End with a strong conclusion that summarizes the key takeaways and reinforces the article's main message.
-   **External Links**: Where appropriate, embed markdown-formatted links `[link text](URL)` to authoritative external sources to validate information and improve SEO ranking.

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Analyze, Don't Just Summarize**: Do not simply rephrase the topic. Use your web search capabilities to research the subject thoroughly and synthesize the information into a unique, high-quality article.
2.  **Strictly Adhere to Reference Structure**: The provided reference `.mdx` file is the template for success. Match its structural flow, heading levels, and the depth of its content.
3.  **SEO is Paramount**: Naturally weave keywords into the title, headings, and body content. Ensure the `description` and `title` are optimized for search engine results pages (SERPs).
