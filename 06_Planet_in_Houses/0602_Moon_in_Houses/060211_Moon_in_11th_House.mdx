This placement harmoniously combines the Moon's nurturing nature with the 11th house's expansive energy for gains and social achievement.

The [11th house](/02_Houses/211_11th_House_in_Vedic_Astrology.mdx), traditionally ruled by Saturn and associated with Aquarius, governs gains, income, friendships, social networks, aspirations, elder siblings, and group associations.
