## Understanding Ketu: The South Node {#understanding-ketu}

Ketu, known as the "Dragon's Tail" in Vedic astrology, is a [shadow planet or lunar node](https://www.astro.com/astrology/in_rahuketu_e.htm) that represents our past-life karma and spiritual liberation. Unlike physical planets, Ketu is a mathematical point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic plane.

### Astrological Significance
Ketu operates on a **18.6-year cycle** and represents:
