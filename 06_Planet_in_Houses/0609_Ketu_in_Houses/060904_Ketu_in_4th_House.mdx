## Introduction
When the mystical **South Node Ketu occupies the 4th house** of your natal chart, it creates a unique karmic blueprint that touches the very foundation of your existence - your home, family, and emotional core. In [Vedic Astrology](https://www.vedanet.com/), this placement is considered particularly significant as it affects the most fundamental aspects of human experience: our sense of belonging, emotional security, and ancestral connections.

The **4th house**, traditionally ruled by the Moon and associated with Cancer, represents our psychological foundation, mother's influence, domestic happiness, and property matters. When Ketu - the shadow planet of spiritual detachment and past-life karma - occupies this sensitive position, it creates a fascinating interplay between material attachments and spiritual liberation.
