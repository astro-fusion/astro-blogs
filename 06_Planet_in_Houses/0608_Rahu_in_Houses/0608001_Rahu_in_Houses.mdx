## Rahu - The Dragon's Head

### Introduction

Rahu, also known as the North Node of the Moon, is one of the most enigmatic and feared entities in Vedic astrology. It is often associated with confusion, illusion, and unexpected events. Rahu's influence can bring about significant changes, disruptions, and sometimes even chaos in a person's life. However, it also has the potential to lead one to great success, fame, and material gains if its energy is harnessed positively.

### Chapter 1: The Nature of Rahu

Rahu is not a physical planet but a shadowy entity. It is considered a malefic force in Vedic astrology. However, its effects are not always negative. Rahu is a master of illusion, and it governs all aspects of worldly desires, materialism, and obsessions. It represents the unconventional, the unorthodox, and the taboo.

Rahu's placement in a horoscope can indicate areas of life where one might experience sudden gains or losses, deception, or breakthroughs. It can also show where a person might struggle with inner demons, addictions, or obsessive behaviors.
