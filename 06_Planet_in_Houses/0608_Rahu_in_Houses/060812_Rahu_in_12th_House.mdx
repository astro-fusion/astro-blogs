# Rahu in 12th House: Spirituality, Liberation & Subconscious Transformation

## Introduction: The House of Liberation and the Unknown

When **Rahu**, the ambitious shadow planet, occupies the **12th House** of spirituality, liberation, and the subconscious mind, it creates one of the most profound and transformative placements in Vedic astrology. This enigmatic combination brings together Rahu's insatiable desires with the 12th House's themes of surrender, liberation (moksha), and transcendence of material limitations.

The 12th House, known as the **Moksha Bhava** in Sanskrit, represents our spiritual liberation, subconscious patterns, foreign connections, isolation, expenses, and the dissolution of ego.
