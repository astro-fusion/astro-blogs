## Strategic Social Success FAQs

Focus on adding value first - share knowledge, make introductions, offer help without expecting immediate returns. Authentic relationship building creates sustainable networks that naturally provide opportunities.

### What's the best way to mix business with friendship when I have Sun in 11th House?
Establish clear boundaries and expectations upfront. Keep business discussions separate from social time, and always prioritize the friendship over the business opportunity. Consider partnerships only with friends who share similar work ethics and communication styles.
