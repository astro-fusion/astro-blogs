## Introduction

The **Sun in 7th house** is one of the most significant placements in Vedic astrology, profoundly influencing marriage, partnerships, and public interactions. This placement, known as **"Kalatra Bhava"** in Sanskrit, governs the most intimate and important relationships in an individual's life.

According to [classical Vedic astrology texts](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/index.htm), the 7th house represents the "other" - spouse, business partners, open enemies, and the general public. When the luminous Sun occupies this house, it creates complex dynamics that can manifest as both powerful attractions and challenging ego conflicts.

Understanding this placement through authentic [Vedic astrology principles](https://icas.org.in/) helps navigate relationship dynamics, choose compatible partners, and maximize success in collaborative ventures.
