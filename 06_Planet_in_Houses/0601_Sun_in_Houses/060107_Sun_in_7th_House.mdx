## Introduction

The **Sun in 7th house** is one of the most significant placements in Vedic astrology, profoundly influencing marriage, partnerships, and public interactions. This placement, known as **"Kalatra Bhava"** in Sanskrit, governs the most intimate and important relationships in an individual's life.
