# Mars in the 12 Astrological Houses

## Understanding Mars Energy in Your Birth Chart

Mars, known as the warrior planet in astrology, represents our drive, ambition, and how we assert ourselves. The house position of Mars in your natal chart reveals where and how you express your energy, aggression, and desires. This placement significantly influences various aspects of your life, from career choices to relationship dynamics.

As the [fourth planet from the Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/), Mars completes its orbit in approximately 687 Earth days. In astrological terms, Mars rules Aries and traditionally co-rules Scorpio, bringing fiery and determined energy to wherever it's placed in your chart.
