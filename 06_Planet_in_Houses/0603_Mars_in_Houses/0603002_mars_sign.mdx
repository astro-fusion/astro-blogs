# Mars in the 12 Zodiac Signs

## Introduction to Mars in Astrology

Mars, the fiery red planet known as the celestial warrior, plays a crucial role in shaping our personalities and life experiences. As the son of the Earth, Mars is known by several Sanskrit names including Angaraka, Lohitanga, Bhouma, Kuja, and Bhauma - each representing different aspects of its astrological influence.

Located approximately 48 million miles from Earth with its distinctive blood-red color, Mars takes about two years to complete one revolution around the Sun. This means Mars stays in each zodiac sign for approximately one and a half months, while Earth completes around 45 rotations on its axis during this period.

## Astrological Significance of Mars

Mars governs several key aspects of human life and personality:

- **Personal Traits**: Courage, adventure, ambition, fighting spirit, energy, and impulsiveness
- **Physical Aspects**: Accidents, operations, surgery, wounds, burns, cuts, bruises, and inflammation
- **Health Conditions**: High fever, hemorrhage, typhoid, measles, pox, cholera, plague, and blood poisoning
- **Material Elements**: Arms and ammunition, military, police, fire, electricity, machines, tools, and weapons
- **Life Areas**: Land, brothers, immovable property, litigation, debts, and enemies

People with strong Martian influence are typically tall and muscular with distinctive red eyes and coarse hair. They tend to be easily irritated and drawn to conflict and competition. Learn more about [planetary influences in astrology](https://www.astro.com/astrology/in_mars_e.htm).
