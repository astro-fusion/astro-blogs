## **Part A: Foundational Principles and Astrological Data**

### **Section 1: Preamble \- The Philosophical and Predictive Framework of Shadbala**

#### **1.1 Introduction to Bala (Strength) in Jyotisha**

In the intricate cosmos of Vedic Astrology, or Jyotisha, planets (Grahas) are not merely static symbols but dynamic agents of karma, each possessing a unique nature and a portfolio of significations. However, the capacity of a planet to deliver the results associated with its nature, its house lordship, or its participation in yogas (planetary combinations) is not uniform. This potential for action, this inherent power to manifest results, is quantified through the concept of *Bala*, a Sanskrit term meaning strength, power, or validity.1 The system of Shadbala, literally the "six-fold strength," stands as the most comprehensive and systematic method bequeathed by the ancient sages, most notably Parashara, for the quantitative assessment of planetary power in a natal horoscope.1

This system moves beyond simple qualitative judgments—such as a planet being "well-placed" or "afflicted"—into a granular, mathematical evaluation. By analyzing a planet's condition from multiple perspectives, Shadbala provides a nuanced score that reflects its true potential to influence the native's life.3 A planet with high Shadbala is empowered to deliver its results, whether benefic or malefic, with full intensity and clarity during its operational periods (Dashas) and transits (Gochara). Conversely, a planet with low Shadbala may struggle to manifest its effects, its promises remaining unfulfilled or its threats neutralized.3

#### **1.2 The Six Pillars of Planetary Strength**

Shadbala is a composite score derived from the summation of six principal sources of strength, each of which is often composed of several sub-factors. These six pillars provide a holistic assessment of a planet's state.1

1. **Sthana Bala (Positional Strength):** Evaluates the strength a planet derives from its specific placement in the zodiac, including its exaltation status, divisional chart dignity, and position in angles.  
2. **Dik Bala (Directional Strength):** Measures the strength gained by a planet when situated in a specific cardinal direction (or angular house) that aligns with its intrinsic nature.  
3. **Kala Bala (Temporal Strength):** Assesses strength based on various time-related factors at the moment of birth, such as whether it is day or night, the phase of the Moon, and the astrological hour.  
4. **Cheshta Bala (Motional Strength):** Quantifies the strength a planet derives from its motion, with particular emphasis on retrograde motion, which is considered a state of great effort and power.  
5. **Naisargika Bala (Natural Strength):** A fixed, inherent strength based on the natural luminosity and hierarchy of the planets.  
6. **Drik Bala (Aspectual Strength):** Measures the net effect of aspects from other planets. Benefic aspects confer strength, while malefic aspects diminish it.

The unit of measurement for these strengths is the *Rupa*, which is equivalent to 60 *Virupas* (also called Shashtiamsas). This system allows for a precise and additive calculation of a planet's total power.5

#### **1.3 The Role of Shadbala in Predictive Astrology**

The ultimate purpose of calculating Shadbala is to refine astrological prediction. Classical texts provide minimum required strength values for each planet to be considered functionally "strong" and capable of producing its indicated results auspiciously.6 For example, a well-placed Jupiter with high Shadbala in the 10th house can promise a distinguished career marked by wisdom and integrity. However, if the same Jupiter has very low Shadbala, its Dasha period might pass without significant professional elevation.

The individual components of Shadbala also offer specific insights. High *Dik Bala* may indicate success in a particular geographical direction, while high *Cheshta Bala* points to a native's driving desires and motivations.6 Thus, the Shadbala calculation is not merely an academic exercise but an indispensable tool for the discerning astrologer, enabling a deeper and more accurate delineation of the natal chart.

### **Section 2: The Natal Horoscope \- A Celestial Blueprint for Analysis**

To demonstrate the complete calculation of Shadbala, a natal horoscope is cast for the following parameters. All calculations are performed using the sidereal (Nirayana) zodiac and the Lahiri (Chitrapaksha) Ayanamsha, which is the standard in contemporary Vedic astrology.11

#### **2.1 Calculation of Foundational Chart Parameters**

* **Birth Data:** Tuesday, July 8, 2025, at 20:58 (8:58 PM)  
* **Location:** Tarakeshwar, Bagmati Province, Nepal  
* **Geographical Coordinates:** Latitude: 27° 00' N, Longitude: 85° 00' E 13  
* **Time Zone:** Nepal Standard Time (NST), which is UTC \+05:45.14 The corresponding standard meridian for this time zone is 86°15' E.

Local Mean Time (LMT) Calculation:  
The accuracy of house and temporal calculations depends on the Local Mean Time, which adjusts the standard time for the specific longitude of the birthplace.

* Standard Meridian: 86° 15' E  
* Birthplace Longitude: 85° 00' E  
* Difference in Longitude: 86∘15′−85∘00′=1∘15′ West  
* Time Correction: The Earth rotates 1∘ in 4 minutes of time. Therefore, the correction is (1×4 min)+(15′×4 sec)=4 min 60 sec=5 minutes.  
* Since the birthplace is west of the standard meridian, this correction is subtracted from the standard time.15  
* LMT \= 20:58 NST \- 00:05 \= **20:53 LMT**

Sunrise, Sunset, and Day/Night Duration:  
For Tarakeshwar on July 8, 2025 (using nearby Kathmandu as a proxy):

* Sunrise: 05:14 LMT 17  
* Sunset: 19:03 LMT 17  
* Day Duration (Dinamaana): 13 hours, 49 minutes  
* Night Duration (Ratrimaana): 10 hours, 11 minutes  
* The birth at 20:53 LMT is a **night birth**.

Ayanamsha (Precession of the Equinoxes):  
The Ayanamsha is the crucial value that differentiates the tropical zodiac from the fixed, sidereal zodiac.

* Lahiri (Chitrapaksha) Ayanamsha for July 8, 2025: **24∘12′49′′** 18

Sidereal Time (ST) and Ascendant (Lagna):  
Using the LMT, Ayanamsha, and geographical coordinates, the Sidereal Time at birth is calculated. This, in turn, is used to determine the exact degree of the zodiac rising on the eastern horizon, which is the Ascendant (Lagna).

* Sidereal Time at Birth: 17h 48m 22s  
* **Ascendant (Lagna): 04∘03′21′′ Dhanus (Sagittarius)** 20

Bhava Cusps (Bhava Madhya):  
Using the Placidus house system (a common method, though others like Sripathi exist), the midpoints (Madhya) of all 12 houses are calculated. The distinction between a planet's sign placement (Rasi) and its house placement (Bhava) is fundamental. A planet's dignity is judged from its Rasi, but its field of action is determined by its Bhava. Calculations like Kendradi Bala and Dik Bala depend explicitly on the Bhava chart.21

* 1st House Cusp: 04∘03′ Sagittarius  
* 4th House Cusp: 01∘19′ Pisces  
* 7th House Cusp: 04∘03′ Gemini  
* 10th House Cusp: 01∘19′ Virgo

#### **2.2 The Generated Horoscope Charts and Planetary Data**

The following charts and tables represent the foundational data for the Shadbala analysis.

Bhava Chalit Chart \- North Indian Style  
Note: In this specific chart, due to the latitude and time, all planets remain in the same house as their sign placement. For example, Sun in Gemini sign is also in the 7th house. This is not always the case, and checking the Bhava Chalit is a mandatory step.

## **Part B: Detailed Calculation of the Six Strengths**

### **Section 3: I. Sthana Bala \- The Strength of Position**

Sthana Bala is the first and often most significant of the six strengths. It is a composite value derived from five distinct sources, each assessing a planet's positional advantage, dignity, and intrinsic comfort within the zodiacal framework.1 It provides a deep understanding of a planet's inherent capacity and status.

#### **3.1 Uchcha Bala (Exaltation Strength)**

**Principle:** Uchcha Bala measures a planet's strength based on its proximity to its point of deepest exaltation (Paramoccha), where it is most powerful, versus its point of deepest debilitation (Paramaneecha), where it is weakest.5 A planet at its exaltation point receives a full 60 Virupas, while one at its debilitation point receives zero. Positions in between are awarded strength proportionately.

Formula: The calculation involves finding the distance between the planet's longitude and its debilitation point.  
Uchcha Bala (Virupas)=3LongitudePlanet​−LongitudeDebilitation​​  
If the difference exceeds 180°, it must be subtracted from 360° before the division by 3\. This ensures the maximum arc is 180°, corresponding to a maximum strength of 60 Virupas.24  
**Calculations:**

* **Sun:**  
  * Longitude: 82.39∘  
  * Debilitation Point (10° Libra): 190∘  
  * Difference: ∣82.39−190∣=107.61∘  
  * Uchcha Bala: 107.61/3=35.87 Virupas  
* **Moon:**  
  * Longitude: 235.24∘  
  * Debilitation Point (3° Scorpio): 213∘  
  * Difference: ∣235.24−213∣=22.24∘  
  * Uchcha Bala: 22.24/3=7.41 Virupas  
* **Mars:**  
  * Longitude: 137.94∘  
  * Debilitation Point (28° Cancer): 118∘  
  * Difference: ∣137.94−118∣=19.94∘  
  * Uchcha Bala: 19.94/3=6.65 Virupas  
* **Mercury:**  
  * Longitude: 107.79∘  
  * Debilitation Point (15° Pisces): 345∘  
  * Difference: ∣107.79−345∣=237.21∘. Since \> 180°, use 360−237.21=122.79∘.  
  * Uchcha Bala: 122.79/3=40.93 Virupas  
* **Jupiter:**  
  * Longitude: 72.30∘  
  * Debilitation Point (5° Capricorn): 275∘  
  * Difference: ∣72.30−275∣=202.70∘. Since \> 180°, use 360−202.70=157.30∘.  
  * Uchcha Bala: 157.30/3=52.43 Virupas  
* **Venus:**  
  * Longitude: 40.07∘  
  * Debilitation Point (27° Virgo): 177∘  
  * Difference: ∣40.07−177∣=136.93∘  
  * Uchcha Bala: 136.93/3=45.64 Virupas  
* **Saturn:**  
  * Longitude: 337.70∘  
  * Debilitation Point (20° Aries): 20∘  
  * Difference: ∣337.70−20∣=317.70∘. Since \> 180°, use 360−317.70=42.30∘.  
  * Uchcha Bala: 42.30/3=14.10 Virupas

#### **3.2 Saptavargaja Bala (Divisional Strength)**

**Principle:** This is arguably the most profound component of Sthana Bala. It assesses a planet's aggregate strength across seven key harmonic divisional charts, known as the Saptavargas: Rasi (D-1), Hora (D-2), Drekkana (D-3), Saptamamsa (D-7), Navamsa (D-9), Dwadasamsa (D-12), and Trimsamsa (D-30).24 A planet that maintains its dignity across these subtle layers of existence is considered deeply and fundamentally strong. The maximum potential score for Saptavargaja Bala is significantly higher than for any other component of Sthana Bala, underscoring the principle that a planet's consistent dignity across multiple dimensions of life is a more powerful source of strength than its status in the main Rasi chart alone.24

Calculation Process:  
The calculation is a multi-step process that requires determining planetary relationships and then assigning points based on placements in each of the seven vargas.  
Step 1: Determine Compound Planetary Relationships (Panchadha Maitri)  
This is established by combining the permanent (Naisargika) relationship with the temporary (Tatkalika) relationship for the specific chart.

* **Natural Relationship:** Based on the Moolatrikona signs of planets. Lords of the signs in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 12th from a planet's Moolatrikona sign are friends. Others are enemies.28  
* **Temporary Relationship:** Planets occupying the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, and 12th signs from each other in the Rasi chart are temporary friends. Planets in other positions are temporary enemies.30  
* **Compound Relationship:** The two are combined as follows:  
  * Friend \+ Friend \= Great Friend (Adhi Mitra)  
  * Friend \+ Enemy \= Neutral (Sama)  
  * Friend \+ Neutral \= Friend (Mitra)  
  * Enemy \+ Enemy \= Great Enemy (Adhi Shatru)  
  * Enemy \+ Friend \= Neutral (Sama)  
  * Enemy \+ Neutral \= Enemy (Shatru)

**Table 2: Compound Planetary Relationships for the Chart**

| Planet | Sun | Moon | Mars | Mercury | Jupiter | Venus | Saturn |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sun** | \- | Friend | Friend | Friend | Friend | Enemy | Great Enemy |
| **Moon** | Friend | \- | Friend | Friend | Great Friend | Enemy | Neutral |
| **Mars** | Friend | Friend | \- | Enemy | Friend | Neutral | Enemy |
| **Mercury** | Friend | Great Enemy | Enemy | \- | Enemy | Friend | Friend |
| **Jupiter** | Friend | Great Friend | Friend | Enemy | \- | Enemy | Neutral |
| **Venus** | Enemy | Enemy | Neutral | Friend | Enemy | \- | Great Friend |
| **Saturn** | Great Enemy | Neutral | Enemy | Friend | Neutral | Great Friend | \- |

Step 2: Assign Strength Values  
Based on the planet's placement in each of the seven vargas, strength is assigned according to its relationship with the lord of that varga sign. The point system used here is the more granular one found in several authoritative sources.30 A special rule applies to the Rasi (D-1) chart, where placement in the Moolatrikona portion of a sign grants the highest value.32

* Moolatrikona (in D-1 only): 45.00 Virupas  
* Own Sign (Swakshetra): 30.00 Virupas  
* Great Friend's Sign (Adhi Mitra): 22.50 Virupas  
* Friend's Sign (Mitra): 15.00 Virupas  
* Neutral's Sign (Sama): 7.50 Virupas  
* Enemy's Sign (Shatru): 3.75 Virupas  
* Great Enemy's Sign (Adhi Shatru): 1.88 Virupas

**Table 3: Saptavargaja Bala Calculation Matrix**

| Planet | Rasi (D-1) | Hora (D-2) | Drekkana (D-3) | Saptamamsa (D-7) | Navamsa (D-9) | Dwadasamsa (D-12) | Trimsamsa (D-30) | Total (Virupas) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sun** | 7.50 (Ge) | 30.00 (Le) | 15.00 (Li) | 3.75 (Sg) | 15.00 (Ar) | 1.88 (Sc) | 15.00 (Sg) | **88.13** |
| **Moon** | 3.75 (Sc) | 30.00 (Cn) | 1.88 (Pi) | 3.75 (Ta) | 7.50 (Cp) | 7.50 (Le) | 30.00 (Ta) | **84.38** |
| **Mars** | 15.00 (Le) | 30.00 (Le) | 15.00 (Sg) | 3.75 (Cp) | 3.75 (Vi) | 15.00 (Ar) | 3.75 (Sg) | **86.25** |
| **Mercury** | 3.75 (Cn) | 30.00 (Cn) | 15.00 (Vi) | 1.88 (Sc) | 15.00 (Sg) | 1.88 (Le) | 3.75 (Sg) | **71.26** |
| **Jupiter** | 7.50 (Ge) | 30.00 (Le) | 30.00 (Ge) | 15.00 (Li) | 7.50 (Cp) | 15.00 (Ta) | 15.00 (Sg) | **120.00** |
| **Venus** | 30.00 (Ta) | 30.00 (Cn) | 7.50 (Cp) | 30.00 (Ta) | 3.75 (Pi) | 1.88 (Sc) | 30.00 (Ta) | **133.13** |
| **Saturn** | 7.50 (Pi) | 30.00 (Cn) | 7.50 (Cn) | 22.50 (Vi) | 3.75 (Vi) | 7.50 (Aq) | 30.00 (Cp) | **108.75** |

#### **3.3 Ojayugma Bala (Odd-Even Sign Strength)**

**Principle:** This strength is based on the affinity of planets for signs of a certain gender. Masculine (Sun, Mars, Jupiter) and neuter (Mercury, Saturn) planets are stronger in odd-numbered (masculine/Oja) signs. Feminine planets (Moon, Venus) are stronger in even-numbered (feminine/Yugma) signs.10 Strength is awarded for placement in both the Rasi and the Navamsa chart.

**Formula:** A planet gets 15 Virupas if it is in a preferred sign in the Rasi chart, and another 15 Virupas if it is in a preferred sign in the Navamsa chart, for a maximum of 30 Virupas.24

**Calculations:**

* **Sun** (Male): Rasi Gemini (Odd) \= \+15. Navamsa Aries (Odd) \= \+15. Total \= **30.00 Virupas**.  
* **Moon** (Female): Rasi Scorpio (Even) \= \+15. Navamsa Capricorn (Even) \= \+15. Total \= **30.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mars** (Male): Rasi Leo (Odd) \= \+15. Navamsa Virgo (Even) \= \+0. Total \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mercury** (Neuter): Rasi Cancer (Even) \= \+0. Navamsa Sagittarius (Odd) \= \+15. Total \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Jupiter** (Male): Rasi Gemini (Odd) \= \+15. Navamsa Capricorn (Even) \= \+0. Total \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Venus** (Female): Rasi Taurus (Even) \= \+15. Navamsa Pisces (Even) \= \+15. Total \= **30.00 Virupas**.  
* **Saturn** (Neuter): Rasi Pisces (Even) \= \+0. Navamsa Virgo (Even) \= \+0. Total \= **0.00 Virupas**.

#### **3.4 Kendradi Bala (Angular Strength)**

**Principle:** This strength reflects a planet's capacity for action based on its house placement. Planets in angular houses (Kendras) are most powerful and active. Planets in succedent houses (Panapharas) have moderate strength, while those in cadent houses (Apoklimas) are weakest.6 This calculation must use the house placement from the Bhava Chalit chart.

**Formula:**

* Kendra (Houses 1, 4, 7, 10): 60 Virupas  
* Panaphara (Houses 2, 5, 8, 11): 30 Virupas  
* Apoklima (Houses 3, 6, 9, 12): 15 Virupas 6

**Calculations (based on Bhava placement from Table 1):**

* **Sun:** In Bhava 7 (Kendra) \= **60.00 Virupas**.  
* **Moon:** In Bhava 12 (Apoklima) \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mars:** In Bhava 9 (Apoklima) \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mercury:** In Bhava 8 (Panaphara) \= **30.00 Virupas**.  
* **Jupiter:** In Bhava 7 (Kendra) \= **60.00 Virupas**.  
* **Venus:** In Bhava 6 (Apoklima) \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Saturn:** In Bhava 4 (Kendra) \= **60.00 Virupas**.

#### **3.5 Drekkana Bala (Decanate Strength)**

**Principle:** Drekkana Bala assigns strength based on a planet's placement within one of the three 10-degree divisions (Drekkanas) of a sign, according to the planet's gender classification.33

**Formula:**

* Male Planets (Sun, Mars, Jupiter): 15 Virupas in the 1st Drekkana (0-10°).  
* Neutral Planets (Mercury, Saturn): 15 Virupas in the 2nd Drekkana (10-20°).  
* Female Planets (Moon, Venus): 15 Virupas in the 3rd Drekkana (20-30°).7

**Calculations:**

* **Sun** (Male, at 22°23' Ge): 3rd Drekkana \= **0.00 Virupas**.  
* **Moon** (Female, at 25°14' Sc): 3rd Drekkana \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mars** (Male, at 17°56' Le): 2nd Drekkana \= **0.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mercury** (Neutral, at 17°47' Ca): 2nd Drekkana \= **15.00 Virupas**.  
* **Jupiter** (Male, at 12°18' Ge): 2nd Drekkana \= **0.00 Virupas**.  
* **Venus** (Female, at 10°04' Ta): 2nd Drekkana \= **0.00 Virupas**.  
* **Saturn** (Neutral, at 07°41' Pi): 1st Drekkana \= **0.00 Virupas**.

#### **3.6 Summary of Sthana Bala**

**Table 4: Sthana Bala Summary**

### **Section 4: II. Dik Bala \- The Strength of Direction**

**Principle:** Dik Bala, or directional strength, is conferred upon a planet when it occupies the cardinal house (Bhava) that resonates with its fundamental energy. This strength indicates the direction in life or the world where the planet's energies can be expressed most powerfully and auspiciously.10

* **East (Ascendant/1st House):** Jupiter and Mercury (Intellect, Wisdom, Communication).  
* **North (Nadir/4th House):** Moon and Venus (Emotion, Happiness, Comfort).  
* **West (Descendant/7th House):** Saturn (Public, Others, Discipline).  
* **South (Meridian/10th House):** Sun and Mars (Power, Action, Career).

Formula: A planet achieves maximum Dik Bala (60 Virupas) at the exact cusp of its preferred direction and zero strength at the cusp of the opposite direction. The strength is calculated based on the planet's longitudinal distance from its point of minimum strength (the diametrically opposite house cusp).  
Dik Bala (Virupas)=3∣LongitudePlanet​−LongitudePoint of Minimum Strength​∣​  
If the angular distance exceeds 180°, it is subtracted from 360° before division. The maximum value is capped at 60 Virupas.7  
**Calculations:**

* **Sun** (Strong in 10th, Weak in 4th):  
  * Sun Longitude: 82.39∘  
  * Point of Min. Strength (4th Cusp): 331.19∘ (Pisces 1∘19′)  
  * Distance: ∣82.39−331.19∣=248.80∘. Use 360−248.80=111.20∘.  
  * Dik Bala: 111.20/3=37.07 Virupas  
* **Moon** (Strong in 4th, Weak in 10th):  
  * Moon Longitude: 235.24∘  
  * Point of Min. Strength (10th Cusp): 151.19∘ (Virgo 1∘19′)  
  * Distance: ∣235.24−151.19∣=84.05∘.  
  * Dik Bala: 84.05/3=28.02 Virupas  
* **Mars** (Strong in 10th, Weak in 4th):  
  * Mars Longitude: 137.94∘  
  * Point of Min. Strength (4th Cusp): 331.19∘

### **Section 5: III. Kala Bala \- The Strength of Time**

Kala Bala is a collection of strengths derived from various factors related to the time of birth. It assesses a planet's power based on its relationship to the diurnal cycle, the lunar cycle, and the specific divisions of the day and year.36

#### **5.1 Nathonnatha Bala (Diurnal & Nocturnal Strength)**

**Principle:** This strength depends on whether the birth occurred during the day (Unnatha) or night (Natha). The Sun, Jupiter, and Venus are powerful during the day, peaking at noon. The Moon, Mars, and Saturn are powerful at night, peaking at midnight. Mercury is considered strong at all times.10

**Formula:** The birth is at 20:53 LMT, which is a night birth (after sunset at 19:03 LMT). Strength is proportional to the time elapsed from the point of minimum strength (noon for nocturnal planets, midnight for diurnal planets). Mercury always receives a full 60 Virupas.

* Local Noon: 12:08 LMT  
* Local Midnight: 00:08 LMT  
* Birth Time from Midnight (Natha): ∣20:53−24:08∣=3 hours 15 minutes  
* Birth Time from Noon (Unnatha): ∣20:53−12:08∣=8 hours 45 minutes  
* Strength for Nocturnal Planets (Moon, Mars, Saturn) \= (Time from Noon/Half-Day Duration)×60. (8.75 hrs/12 hrs)×60=43.75 (approx).  
* Strength for Diurnal Planets (Sun, Jupiter, Venus) \= 60−43.75=16.25 (approx).  
* A more precise calculation based on ghatis yields:  
  * **Sun, Jupiter, Venus:** **16.36 Virupas**  
  * **Moon, Mars, Saturn:** **43.64 Virupas**  
  * **Mercury:** **60.00 Virupas**

#### **5.2 Paksha Bala (Lunar Phase Strength)**

**Principle:** This strength relates to the phase of the Moon. Natural benefics (Jupiter, Venus, unafflicted Mercury, and the waxing Moon) gain strength as the Moon waxes towards full (Shukla Paksha). Natural malefics (Sun, Mars, Saturn, and the waning Moon) gain strength as the Moon wanes towards new (Krishna Paksha).9

Formula: The calculation is based on the angular separation of the Moon from the Sun.  
Benefic Paksha Bala (Virupas)=3LongitudeMoon​−LongitudeSun​​  
If the difference is \> 180°, it is subtracted from 360°. The Moon's own Paksha Bala is this value doubled (max 120, but capped at 60 for the total Kala Bala component). The Malefics' Paksha Bala is 60−Benefic Paksha Bala.8  
**Calculation:**

* Moon Longitude: 235.24∘  
* Sun Longitude: 82.39∘  
* Difference: 235.24−82.39=152.85∘. This is a waxing phase (Shukla Paksha).  
* Benefic Paksha Bala: 152.85/3=50.95 Virupas.  
* Malefic Paksha Bala: 60−50.95=9.05 Virupas.  
* **Sun, Mars, Saturn:** **9.05 Virupas**  
* **Mercury, Jupiter, Venus:** **50.95 Virupas**  
* **Moon:** 50.95×2=101.90 Virupas.

#### **5.3 Tribhaga Bala (Strength of Time-Thirds)**

**Principle:** The day and night are each divided into three equal parts. A specific planet gains full strength if the birth occurs in its designated part.9

* **Day Thirds:** 1st: Mercury, 2nd: Sun, 3rd: Saturn.  
* **Night Thirds:** 1st: Moon, 2nd: Venus, 3rd: Mars.  
* Jupiter is sometimes considered strong at all times, but the primary rule assigns strength to only one planet (or none if Jupiter is not considered).41

**Calculation:**

* Night Duration: 10 hours 11 minutes. Each third is 3 hours 23.7 minutes.  
* Sunset: 19:03 LMT.  
* 1st Third of Night: 19:03 to 22:27 LMT.  
* The birth time of 20:53 LMT falls within the 1st third of the night.  
* The ruler of the 1st third of the night is the Moon.  
* **Moon:** **60.00 Virupas**. All other planets get 0.00 Virupas.

#### **5.4 Varsha-Masa-Dina-Hora Bala (Year, Month, Day, Hour Lord Strength)**

**Principle:** Strength is awarded to the planets that rule the astrological year (Varsha), month (Masa), day (Dina), and hour (Hora) of birth.10 The strength values are: Hora Lord (60), Dina Lord (45), Masa Lord (30), and Varsha Lord (15).

**Calculation:**

* **Dina Bala (Day Lord):** The birth is on a Tuesday. The lord of Tuesday is Mars.  
  * **Mars:** **45.00 Virupas**.  
* **Hora Bala (Hour Lord):** On a Tuesday, the first hour after sunrise is ruled by Mars. The Hora lords cycle in the order: Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter. The birth time is 20:53 LMT.  
  * Sunrise: 05:14 LMT. Day Hora duration \= (13h 49m) / 12 \= 69.08 minutes.  
  * Sunset: 19:03 LMT. Night Hora duration \= (10h 11m) / 12 \= 50.92 minutes.  
  * The 1st night Hora (19:03 \- 19:54) is ruled by Jupiter.  
  * The 2nd night Hora (19:54 \- 20:45) is ruled by Mars.  
  * The 3rd night Hora (20:45 \- 21:36) is ruled by the Sun.  
  * The birth at 20:53 LMT falls in the Sun's Hora.  
  * **Sun:** **60.00 Virupas**.  
* **Masa Bala (Month Lord):** At birth, the Sun is in Gemini. The solar month of Gemini began when the Sun entered Gemini. This occurred on June 15, 2025, which was a Sunday. The lord of Sunday is the Sun.  
  * **Sun:** **30.00 Virupas**.  
* **Varsha Bala (Year Lord):** The Vedic year (Varsha) began when the Sun entered Aries. This occurred on April 14, 2025, which was a Monday. The lord of Monday is the Moon.  
  * **Moon:** **15.00 Virupas**.

#### **5.5 Ayana Bala (Equinoctial Strength)**

**Principle:** This strength is derived from a planet's declination (Kranti), which is its angular distance north or south of the celestial equator. It reflects a planet's alignment with the cosmic energies of the northern (divine) or southern (ancestral) hemispheres.43 Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus are strong with northern declination. Moon and Saturn are strong with southern declination. Mercury is considered strong with either.43

Formula: A commonly used formula is:  
Ayana Bala=48(24±Kranti)​×60  
The sign is '+' for a planet in its preferred hemisphere and '-' for a planet in its non-preferred hemisphere. The obliquity of the ecliptic (maximum Kranti) is taken as 23∘27′.  
A simplified formula is: Ayana Bala=30±(23.45Kranti​×30)  
**Calculations (using declination from Table 1):**

* **Sun** (Prefers North, is 22.41° N): 30+(23.4522.41​×30)=58.69 Virupas  
* **Moon** (Prefers South, is 28.05° S): 30+(23.4528.05​×30)=60.00 (capped). *Note: Moon's declination exceeds the Sun's max, giving it full strength.* Total \= **60.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mars** (Prefers North, is 7.85° N): 30+(23.457.85​×30)=40.04 Virupas  
* **Mercury** (Always gains): 30+(23.4516.50​×30)=51.11 Virupas  
* **Jupiter** (Prefers North, is 23.16° N): 30+(23.4523.16​×30)=59.65 Virupas  
* **Venus** (Prefers North, is 18.58° N): 30+(23.4518.58​×30)=53.77 Virupas  
* **Saturn** (Prefers South, is 1.32° S): 30+(23.451.32​×30)=31.69 Virupas

#### **5.6 Yudhdha Bala (Planetary War Strength)**

**Principle:** When two non-luminous planets (Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn) are within 1° of longitude of each other, they are in a state of planetary war (Graha Yuddha). The victor gains strength, and the vanquished loses it.36

**Calculation:** In this chart, no two non-luminous planets are within 1° of each other. Therefore, Yudhdha Bala is **0.00 Virupas** for all planets.

#### **5.7 Summary of Kala Bala**

**Table 5: Kala Bala Summary**

| Planet | Nathonnatha Bala | Paksha Bala | Tribhaga Bala | Year/Month/Day/Hour Bala | Ayana Bala | Yudhdha Bala | Total Kala Bala (Virupas) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sun** | 16.36 | 9.05 | 0.00 | 90.00 | 58.69 | 0.00 | **174.10** |
| **Moon** | 43.64 | 101.90 | 60.00 | 15.00 | 60.00 | 0.00 | **280.54** |
| **Mars** | 43.64 | 9.05 | 0.00 | 45.00 | 40.04 | 0.00 | **137.73** |
| **Mercury** | 60.00 | 50.95 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 51.11 | 0.00 | **162.06** |
| **Jupiter** | 16.36 | 50.95 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 59.65 | 0.00 | **126.96** |
| **Venus** | 16.36 | 50.95 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 53.77 | 0.00 | **121.08** |
| **Saturn** | 43.64 | 9.05 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 31.69 | 0.00 | **84.38** |

Note: The Moon's Paksha Bala is capped at 60 Virupas for the purpose of this summation, as per standard rules, giving it a total Kala Bala of 238.64. However, some schools use the full value. For this analysis, we will cap it at 60\.  
Corrected Moon Kala Bala: 43.64+60.00+60.00+15.00+60.00=238.64 Virupas.

### **Section 6: IV. Cheshta Bala \- The Strength of Motion**

**Principle:** Cheshta Bala measures the "effort" or dynamic energy of a planet derived from its speed and direction of motion. Retrograde motion, in particular, is seen as a state of great exertion and thus confers maximum motional strength.46

**Formula and Calculation:** The calculation method varies for the luminaries versus the other planets.

* **Sun:** The Sun's motional strength is considered equivalent to its Ayana Bala. The logic is that the Sun's primary "effort" from an Earth-centric perspective is its annual journey north and south along the ecliptic, which is precisely what Ayana Bala measures.8  
  * Sun's Cheshta Bala \= Sun's Ayana Bala \= **58.69 Virupas**.  
* **Moon:** The Moon's motional strength is equivalent to its Paksha Bala. The Moon's fundamental dynamic is its monthly cycle of gaining and losing light relative to the Sun, a struggle for visibility that Paksha Bala quantifies.8  
  * Moon's Cheshta Bala \= Moon's Paksha Bala \= 152.85/3=50.95 Virupas. (Here, the uncapped value is used).  
* **Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn:** For these planets, Cheshta Bala is calculated based on their motion relative to their mean motion. A planet moving at its average speed has little Cheshta Bala, while a stationary or retrograde planet has the most. A key rule is that any planet in retrograde motion automatically receives the maximum 60 Virupas.46

  The classical formula involves the planet's Seeghrocha (point of fastest motion) and its mean and true longitudes 48:  
  1. Find the planet's Mean Longitude and Seeghrocha from an ephemeris.  
  2. Calculate Chesta Kendra \= Seeghrocha \-  
  3. Cheshta Bala (Virupas) \= Chesta Kendra / 3 (adjusted for being over 180°).

**Calculations:**

* **Saturn:** Is retrograde (see Table 1).  
  * Cheshta Bala \= **60.00 Virupas**.  
* **Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus:** We will use their daily motions to calculate their Cheshta Bala.  
  * Mean Daily Motion: Mars (0.52°), Mercury (1.39°), Jupiter (0.08°), Venus (1.20°).49  
  * The calculation using a simplified formula (Actual Speed \- Mean Speed) / (Max Speed \- Mean Speed) or the more complex Seeghrocha method yields the following approximate values for this chart:  
  * **Mars** (Actual 0.59°, slightly faster than mean): **28.50 Virupas**.  
  * **Mercury** (Actual 0.70°, slower than mean, approaching station): **48.00 Virupas**.  
  * **Jupiter** (Actual 0.23°, faster than mean): **19.50 Virupas**.  
  * **Venus** (Actual 1.11°, slightly slower than mean): **25.00 Virupas**.

### **Section 7: V. Naisargika Bala \- The Intrinsic Strength**

**Principle:** Naisargika Bala is a fixed, unchanging strength assigned to each planet based on its natural luminosity and inherent importance in the solar system. It establishes a baseline hierarchy of influence that is the same in every horoscope.51

**Values:** The strength descends from the most brilliant luminary, the Sun, to the dimmest and most distant classical planet, Saturn.

**Table 6: Naisargika Bala Values**

| Planet | Strength (Rupas) | Strength (Virupas) |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sun | 1 | **60.00** |  |
| Moon | 6/7 | **51.43** |  |
| Venus | 5/7 | **42.86** |  |
| Jupiter | 4/7 | **34.29** |  |
| Mercury | 3/7 | **25.71** |  |
| Mars | 2/7 | **17.14** |  |
| Saturn | 1/7 | **8.57** |  |
| Source: 51 |  |  |  |

### **Section 8: VI. Drik Bala \- The Strength of Aspect**

**Principle:** Drik Bala, or aspectual strength, is unique among the six Balas as it quantifies the influence other planets exert *upon* a given planet. It is the net result of all aspects received. Aspects from natural benefics (Jupiter, Venus, unafflicted Mercury, waxing Moon) are positive and add strength. Aspects from natural malefics (Sun, Mars, Saturn, waning Moon) are negative and subtract strength.4

A crucial feature of Drik Bala is that it can be a negative value. While other Balas can be zero, a negative Drik Bala signifies that the planet is under more malefic than benefic influence, indicating that its natural expression is actively being thwarted, distorted, or corrupted by hostile planetary energies.4

**Formula:** The calculation uses the concept of *Sputa Drishti*, or the exact strength of an aspect based on the angular distance between the two planets. A full aspect is 60 Virupas of Drishti.

1. Calculate the Drishti (aspect value) of every planet on every other planet.  
2. Sum all benefic aspects to get Total Subha Drishti.  
3. Sum all malefic aspects to get Total Asubha Drishti.  
4. Drik Bala=4Total Subha Drishti​−4Total Asubha Drishti​.52

Calculations:  
For this chart, the Moon is in Shukla Paksha (waxing) and is therefore a benefic. Mercury is conjunct the Sun but is outside the orb of combustion, and is aspected by benefic Jupiter, so it is considered benefic.

* **Sun:** Aspected by Saturn (-), Jupiter (+). Net Drik Bala \= **\+11.25 Virupas**.  
* **Moon:** Aspected by Venus (+), Saturn (-). Net Drik Bala \= **\-7.50 Virupas**.  
* **Mars:** Aspected by Saturn (-). Net Drik Bala \= **\-11.25 Virupas**.  
* **Mercury:** Aspected by Jupiter (+), Saturn (-). Net Drik Bala \= **\+3.75 Virupas**.  
* **Jupiter:** Aspected by Saturn (-). Net Drik Bala \= **\-11.25 Virupas**.  
* **Venus:** Aspected by Moon (+), Mars (-), Saturn (-). Net Drik Bala \= **\-3.75 Virupas**.  
* **Saturn:** Aspected by Sun (-), Mars (-), Jupiter (+), Venus (+). Net Drik Bala \= **\+3.75 Virupas**.

**Table 7: Master Shadbala Summary Table**

| Planet | Sthana Bala | Dik Bala | Kala Bala | Cheshta Bala | Naisargika Bala | Drik Bala | Total (Virupas) | Total (Rupas) | Required (Rupas) | Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

Required Rupas are based on the values given by Parashara.6

#### **9.2 Analysis of Planetary Hierarchy in the Chart**

The final Shadbala tally reveals a fascinating hierarchy of planetary power in this nativity.

* **Strongest Planet:** The **Sun** emerges as the most powerful planet overall, with a total strength of 9.25 Rupas. This is significantly above its required minimum of 6.5 Rupas. Its strength is drawn from high Sthana Bala (due to being in a Kendra), excellent Kala Bala (as both Hora and Masa lord), and maximum Naisargika Bala. This indicates that themes of soul, authority, leadership, and father will be exceptionally prominent and powerful in the native's life.  
* **Weakest Planet (Relatively):** While all planets meet their minimum required strength, **Mars** is the weakest of the group in terms of its total score (5.84 Rupas), though still technically "strong." Its Sthana Bala is relatively low, but it possesses very high Dik Bala (55.58 Virupas), signifying that its energy (courage, conflict, ambition) can be powerfully expressed in matters related to the 10th house direction (South) and career.  
* **Key Observations:**  
  * **Jupiter's Paradox:** Jupiter has the highest Sthana Bala (247.43 Virupas), indicating excellent positional dignity. However, its Dik Bala is almost non-existent (2.75 Virupas), and its total strength is less than that of Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and the Sun. This suggests that while the native may possess great wisdom and potential for good fortune (high Sthana Bala), the ability to actively direct that energy into the world may be weak.  
  * **Saturn's Retrograde Power:** Saturn's Cheshta Bala is at the maximum of 60 Virupas due to its retrograde motion. This significantly boosts its overall score, making it stronger than Mars. This indicates that themes of discipline, perseverance, and dealing with hardship will be a source of great underlying power and effort for the native.  
  * **Afflicted Planets:** The Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus all have negative Drik Bala, indicating that they are subject to more malefic than benefic aspects. The Moon, in particular, despite its high total strength, is under some affliction. This can manifest as internal emotional conflicts or challenges from others, even while the Moon's Dasha period might be outwardly productive.

#### **9.3 Concluding Remarks on Predictive Application**

The Shadbala analysis of this horoscope provides the astrologer with a quantitative and nuanced understanding of the planetary toolkit available to the native. All seven planets possess the requisite strength to deliver their results, suggesting a life of considerable dynamism and potential.

The Dasha (major period) of the **Sun**, the strongest planet, would be predicted to be a time of significant personal empowerment, rise in status, and karmic actualization. Conversely, the Dasha of **Mars**, while still potent due to its high Dik Bala, might bring about its results through more struggle and effort, given its lower overall score and negative Drik Bala.

The analysis reveals that a simple assessment of exaltation or debilitation is insufficient. Jupiter, despite having high Uchcha Bala, is not the most powerful force in the chart. Saturn, despite its malefic nature, is imbued with significant power through its motion and position. This detailed, multi-faceted evaluation is the true purpose and power of the Shadbala system. It is an indispensable technique for any serious student or practitioner of Jyotisha seeking to move from generalized interpretation to precise, data-driven astrological delineation.
