## Introduction to Planetary Influences in Vastu

In the interconnected world of Vedic sciences, **Vastu Shastra** and **Astrology (Jyotish)** are two sides of the same coin. Vastu Shastra, the science of architecture, is deeply influenced by the energies of the nine planets (Navagraha) of Vedic Astrology. Each planet governs a specific direction, and the energy of that direction is influenced by the strength and placement of its ruling planet in an individual's horoscope.

By understanding these planetary influences, we can make conscious choices about the design and layout of our homes to enhance the positive energies and mitigate the negative ones.
