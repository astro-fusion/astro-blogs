## Avoiding Inauspicious Planetary Transits

It is important to avoid starting construction activities during inauspicious planetary transits, such as:

- **Retrograde Planets**: When a planet is retrograde, it is considered to be weak and inauspicious. It is best to avoid starting any important work during this time.
- **Combust Planets**: When a planet is combust (too close to the Sun), it loses its strength and becomes inauspicious.
- **Eclipses**: Eclipses are considered to be highly inauspicious. It is best to avoid any important activities during an eclipse.

## Maximizing Beneficial Configurations

To maximize the benefits of auspicious timing, it is important to choose a time when the planetary configurations are favorable.

- **Benefic Planets in Kendras**: The presence of benefic planets like Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury in the Kendra (angular) houses is considered to be very auspicious.
- **Strong Lagna Lord**: The Lagna lord should be strong and well-placed in the chart for the Muhurta.
- **Favorable Nakshatra**: The Nakshatra of the day should be favorable for the activity being performed.

## Conclusion

Timing is everything, especially when it comes to construction activities. By following the guidelines of Muhurta, we can ensure that our homes are built on a foundation of positive cosmic energies, leading to a life of peace, prosperity, and happiness. Always consult a qualified astrologer to determine the most auspicious time for your construction activities.
