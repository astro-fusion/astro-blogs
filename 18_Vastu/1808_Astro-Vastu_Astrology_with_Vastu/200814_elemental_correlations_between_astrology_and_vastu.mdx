In the holistic world of Vedic sciences, the **five elements** or **Pancha Bhutas** (fire, earth, air, water, and ether) are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. They are present in everything, from the stars and planets to our own bodies and homes.

In **Astro-Vastu**, we seek to create a harmonious balance of these five elements in our living spaces to promote health, wealth, and well-being.
