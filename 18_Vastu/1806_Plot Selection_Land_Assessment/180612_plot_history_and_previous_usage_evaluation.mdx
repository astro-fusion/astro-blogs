|----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Hospital/Clinic | Water/Air | Disturbed emotional energy | Fire rituals, copper elements |
| Factory/Industry | Fire | Excessive heat energy | Water features, cooling colors |
| Cemetery/Battlefield | Earth | Heavy, stagnant energy | Air elements, wind chimes |
| Temple/Church | Ether | Heightened spiritual energy | Generally positive; maintain balance |
| Prison/Jail | Earth/Metal | Restrictive, confined energy | Open spaces, east-facing entrances |

## Practical Vastu Applications {#practical-applications}

### Assessing Plot History Through Observation

Before purchasing land, conduct a thorough assessment using these Vastu-approved techniques:

1. **Physical Observation**
   - Examine soil quality and composition across different areas of the plot
   - Note any unusual vegetation patterns or areas where plants don't thrive
   - Look for unexplained temperature variations across the plot

2. **Energy Sensing**
   - Visit the plot at different times of day to assess energy shifts
   - Pay attention to your emotional and physical responses in different areas
   - Use dowsing rods or pendulums if you're trained in their use

3. **Local Investigation**
   - Research historical records at local government offices
   - Interview neighbors about the land's previous uses
   - Consult local historians or elderly residents about significant events

### Remedial Measures Based on Previous Usage

**For Previously Agricultural Land:**
- Generally considered auspicious, especially if productive
- Minimal remediation typically required
- Plant fruit trees to maintain the land's nurturing energy

**For Former Industrial Sites:**
- Perform thorough soil testing for contaminants
- Conduct extensive fire rituals (havan/yagna) to purify elemental energies
- Install water features in the northeast to balance excessive fire element

**For Land with Tragic History:**
- Perform specialized cleansing rituals on astrologically auspicious days
- Install protective boundary markers at the property's corners
- Consider construction delay until multiple purification ceremonies are completed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

1. **Ignoring Subtle Signs**
   Many property buyers focus solely on physical aspects and price, overlooking subtle energetic indicators of problematic plot history.

2. **Insufficient Research**
   Relying only on the seller's information without independent historical verification can lead to discovering negative past usage after purchase.

3. **Rushing Remediation**
   Attempting to cleanse land energy without proper astrological timing or complete historical understanding often yields limited results.

4. **Overlooking Geological Factors**
   Natural features like underground water streams or mineral deposits can amplify or diminish historical energies and should be integrated into evaluation.

5. **Misinterpreting Energy Patterns**
   Attributing all unusual sensations to negative history when they may be natural energy variations or reflections of the evaluator's own energy.
