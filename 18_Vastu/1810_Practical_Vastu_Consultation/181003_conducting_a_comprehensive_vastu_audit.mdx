# Introduction to Conducting a Comprehensive Vastu Audit

A comprehensive Vastu audit is a systematic evaluation of your home's layout and arrangement based on the principles of Vastu Shastra. This ancient Indian science of architecture aims to create a harmonious and positive living environment by balancing the five elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space. A thorough audit can help you identify and rectify Vastu doshas (defects), leading to improved health, wealth, and relationships. This guide provides a detailed, room-by-room process for conducting a Vastu audit to ensure your home is aligned with positive energies.

## Part 1: The Main Entrance â€“ The Gateway of Energy

The main entrance is the most crucial point of a Vastu audit, as it's where energy enters your home.

-   **Direction**: The most auspicious directions for the main entrance are North, East, and Northeast. You can use a compass to determine the exact direction your main door faces.
-   **Appearance**: The entrance should be well-lit, clean, and welcoming. Avoid clutter like shoes or dustbins near the main door.
-   **The Door**: A wooden door is considered ideal. It should be the largest door in the house and open inwards in a clockwise direction. Ensure it doesn't make any creaking sounds.

## Part 2: Room-by-Room Vastu Analysis

### a. Living Room: The Social Hub

-   **Location**: Ideally, the living room should be in the North, East, or Northeast direction.
-   **Seating**: Arrange the furniture, especially the sofa, along the South or West walls. This ensures that when you're seated, you face North or East.
-   **Decor**: Use light and bright colors for the walls. Paintings of flowing water or sunrises on the East wall can enhance positive energy.

### b. Kitchen: The Source of Nourishment

-   **Location**: The Southeast corner of the house is the best location for the kitchen, as it aligns with the fire element. If that's not possible, the Northwest is the next best option.
-   **Stove Placement**: The cooking stove should be in the Southeast corner of the kitchen, and you should face East while cooking.
-   **Sink and Water**: The sink and water taps should be in the Northeast corner, separating the fire and water elements.

### c. Bedroom: The Place of Rest

-   **Location**: The master bedroom should be in the Southwest direction to promote stability and peace.
-   **Bed Placement**: The bed should be placed in the Southwest corner of the room, with your head pointing South or East while sleeping. Avoid sleeping with your head to the North.
-   **Colors**: Use soothing and light colors like shades of white, yellow, or green.

### d. Pooja Room (Prayer Room): The Sacred Space

-   **Location**: The Northeast is the most sacred and ideal direction for a pooja room.
-   **Idol Placement**: The idols should be placed in the Northeast section of the pooja room and should face East or West.
-   **Praying Direction**: When you pray, you should face East.

### e. Bathroom and Toilet: The Area of Disposal

-   **Location**: The Northwest part of the house is the best location for bathrooms and toilets.
-   **Placement**: Avoid having a toilet in the Northeast or Southwest corners.
-   **Cleanliness**: Keep the bathroom doors closed and ensure the space is well-ventilated.

## Part 3: Identifying and Remedying Vastu Doshas

During your audit, you might identify certain aspects of your home that are not Vastu-compliant. These are known as "Vastu doshas." Here are some common doshas and their remedies:

-   **Wrongly Placed Entrance**: If your entrance is in an inauspicious direction like the South or Southwest, you can place a Vastu pyramid or a Swastik symbol near the entrance to neutralize negative energy.
-   **Toilet in the Northeast**: To counter this dosha, place a bowl of sea salt in the toilet and replace it weekly.
-   **Kitchen in the North or Northeast**: This can be remedied by placing a Vastu partition or using specific colors to balance the elements.
-   **Mirrors**: Avoid placing mirrors directly opposite the bed, as they can cause restlessness. Mirrors on the North or East walls are considered beneficial.

## Part 4: Quarterly and Annual Reviews for Ongoing Harmony

A Vastu audit is not a one-time fix. To ensure ongoing harmony, it's important to conduct regular reviews of your space.

-   **Quarterly Reviews**: Every three months, do a quick walkthrough of your home to check for clutter, cleanliness, and any new objects that may be disrupting the energy balance.
-   **Annual Reviews**: Once a year, perform a more detailed audit, paying close to attention to any changes in your life or the environment. This is also a good time to reassess your goals and make any necessary adjustments to your Vastu remedies.

## FAQ

**1. What are the most common Vastu doshas?**
The most common Vastu doshas include a wrongly placed main entrance, a toilet in the Northeast, and a kitchen in the North or Northeast. These can be remedied with simple, non-structural changes.

**2. Can I perform a Vastu audit myself?**
Yes, you can perform a basic Vastu audit yourself using the guidelines in this article. However, for a more in-depth analysis and personalized remedies, it's always best to consult a professional Vastu expert.

**3. How often should I review my home's Vastu?**
It's recommended to do a quick review every quarter and a more detailed audit annually. This ensures that your home remains a harmonious and positive living environment.
