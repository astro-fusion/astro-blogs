### Historical Context

The origins of virtual consultation are rooted in the adaptability of ancient Vastu methods to today’s technological advances. Historically, detailed site visits were essential, but today’s digital tools—such as video calls, online floor plans, and satellite mapping—enable accurate off-site assessments while adhering to Vedic principles[1][3][7].

- **Remedy planning**: Balancing planetary influences through virtual guidance and practical remedies

### Vastu Shastra Applications

Within Vastu practice, remote consultations facilitate:
