- **Role in Astrology:** The Moon represents emotions, intuition, nurturing qualities, and subconscious mind. It influences emotional stability, relationships, and inner peace.
  
- **Influence:** The Moon's influence can manifest as emotional sensitivity, empathy towards others, and a strong connection to family ties. However, it can also indicate mood swings or emotional instability if not balanced properly.

##### Rahu
