Unlike the balanced harmony of [Venus and Jupiter conjunction](/conjunctions/venus-jupiter-conjunction) or the disciplined approach of [Venus and Saturn conjunction](/conjunctions/venus-saturn-conjunction), this alignment brings amplified desires and revolutionary approaches to love that can be either extremely fulfilling or problematically excessive.
