## Introduction

In [Vedic astrology](https://www.astrology.com/vedic), the conjunction of **Sun** and **Rahu** creates the intense **"Grahan Yoga"** or eclipse combination, representing one of the most transformative and challenging planetary alignments possible.

**Eclipse Significance**: Ancient texts describe this conjunction as "Surya Grahan Yoga" - literally meaning solar eclipse yoga. It represents the temporary obscuring of the conscious self by unconscious desires, leading to periods of confusion followed by breakthrough insights and transformation.

Unlike the harmonious flow of [Sun and Venus conjunction](/conjunctions/sun-venus-conjunction) or the structured challenge of [Sun and Saturn conjunction](/conjunctions/sun-saturn-conjunction), this alignment brings sudden, unpredictable changes that can catapult individuals to great heights or create significant challenges requiring spiritual transformation.
