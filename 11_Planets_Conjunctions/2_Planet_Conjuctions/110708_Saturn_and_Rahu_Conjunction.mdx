## Introduction

In [Vedic astrology](https://www.astrology.com/vedic), the conjunction of **Saturn** and **Rahu** creates one of the most complex and challenging combinations known as **"Shrapit Dosha"** or the "Cursed Yoga."

Unlike the harmonious flow of [Saturn and Venus conjunction](/conjunctions/saturn-venus-conjunction) or the structured approach of [Saturn and Jupiter conjunction](/conjunctions/saturn-jupiter-conjunction), this alignment brings the tension between limitation and boundary-breaking that ultimately leads to revolutionary achievements through persistent effort.
