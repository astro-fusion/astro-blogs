## Introduction

In [Vedic astrology](https://www.astrology.com/vedic), the conjunction of **Sun** and **Ketu** creates one of the most spiritually significant alignments known as the **"Spiritual Eclipse"** or **"Moksha Yoga"**. This profound combination merges individual consciousness (Sun) with the energy of liberation (Ketu), leading to ego dissolution, detachment from material concerns, and acceleration toward enlightenment.

<CardContent className="p-4">
**Spiritual Significance**: Ancient scriptures describe this conjunction as "Moksha Karaka" - the liberator from worldly bondage. Unlike Rahu's material obsession, Ketu's influence with the Sun creates a natural inclination toward spiritual pursuits and ultimate liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Unlike the material ambitions of [Sun and Rahu conjunction](/conjunctions/sun-rahu-conjunction) or the structured approach of [Sun and Saturn conjunction](/conjunctions/sun-saturn-conjunction), this alignment brings transcendence of ego and a natural movement toward spiritual realization and cosmic consciousness.
