## Introduction

In [Vedic astrology](https://www.astrology.com/vedic), the conjunction of **Jupiter** and **Saturn** creates the legendary **"Great Conjunction"**, one of the most significant and transformative planetary alignments.

**Historical Significance**: The Great Conjunction occurs approximately every 20 years and has been associated with major societal transformations, the rise and fall of empires, and significant shifts in human consciousness. Ancient astrologers called it the "Conjunction of Destiny."

Unlike the harmonious flow of [Jupiter and Venus conjunction](/conjunctions/jupiter-venus-conjunction) or the revolutionary energy of [Jupiter and Rahu conjunction](/conjunctions/jupiter-rahu-conjunction), this alignment brings the tension between expansion and contraction that ultimately creates sustainable growth and lasting wisdom.
