## Introduction

In [Vedic astrology](https://www.astrology.com/vedic), the conjunction of **Saturn** and **Ketu** creates one of the most spiritually significant and transformative combinations possible, representing the merger of karmic discipline (Saturn) with liberation consciousness (Ketu).

**Moksha Significance**: Ancient texts describe this combination as "Vairagya Shani Yoga" - the yoga of disciplined detachment. It creates individuals who understand that true liberation comes through accepting karmic responsibilities while remaining spiritually free from attachment to results.

Unlike the revolutionary energy of [Saturn and Rahu conjunction](/conjunctions/saturn-rahu-conjunction) or the material focus of [Saturn and Venus conjunction](/conjunctions/saturn-venus-conjunction), this alignment brings transcendence of worldly concerns through patient spiritual discipline and service.
