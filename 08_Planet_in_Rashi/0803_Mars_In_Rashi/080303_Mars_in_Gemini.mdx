# Mars in Gemini: The Sharp-Tongued Strategist (Mithuna Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, when Mars enters Gemini (Mithuna Rashi), the warrior puts down the sword and picks up a pen (or a keyboard). Ruled by Mercury, Gemini is the sign of communication and intellect. Mars is pure energy. The combination creates a **mental warrior**.
*Note: Mercury is an enemy to Mars, but not vice-versa. This creates friction—an overactive, argumentative mind.*

Individuals with Mars in Gemini fight with words. They are quick-witted, sarcastic, and excellent debaters. Their energy is scattered and restless. They can do ten things at once, but finishing them is another story. They are technically skilled and have "dexterous hands."
