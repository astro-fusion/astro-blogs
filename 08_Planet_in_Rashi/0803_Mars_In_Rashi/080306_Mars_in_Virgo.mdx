# Mars in Virgo: The Precise Strategist (Kanya Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, Mars in Virgo (Kanya Rashi) brings the warrior into the library (or the operating room). Ruled by Mercury, an enemy of Mars, this placement creates friction. Mars wants to rush; Virgo wants to check the details twice. The result is a **nervous, critical, but incredibly productive energy**.

Individuals with Mars in Virgo channel their aggression into *work*. They are perfectionists. They don't just want to do it; they want to do it *right*. They can be irritable and fussy because they see flaws everywhere. However, they are the most disciplined and skillful workers of the zodiac.
