# Moon in Cancer: The Nurturing Sensitivity (Karka Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, the Moon is the ruler of Cancer (Karka Rashi). When the Moon is here, it is in its **own home** (Swakshetra). This is the purest expression of lunar energy. The emotions are deep, fluid, and powerful. The mind finds peace in nurturing, connection, and creating a safe harbor.

Individuals with Moon in Cancer are the mothers of the zodiac (regardless of gender). They have immense empathy and intuition. They can sense what you are feeling before you say a word. However, because they are so open to emotions, they are easily hurt and can be prone to moodiness and defensive withdrawal.
