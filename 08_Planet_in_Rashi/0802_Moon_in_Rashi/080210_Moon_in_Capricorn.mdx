# Moon in Capricorn: The Disciplined Pragmatist (Makara Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, the Moon in Capricorn (Makara Rashi) places the emotional mind in the strict environment of Saturn. This is a challenging but powerful placement. The soft Moon is forced to "grow up" fast. Emotions are controlled, regulated, and often suppressed for the sake of long-term goals.

Individuals with Moon in Capricorn are not cold; they are protective. They view emotions as a vulnerability. Their emotional security comes from **achievement** and **status**. They feel safe when they are in control of their destiny. They are the responsible adults of the zodiac, often taking burdens far beyond their years.
