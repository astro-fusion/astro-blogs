# Sun in Taurus: The Stable Builder of the Zodiac (Vrishabha Rashi)

## Introduction

When the Sun enters Taurus (Vrishabha Rashi), the fiery king enters the lush, grounded pasture of Venus. This is a placement of stability, endurance, and resource accumulation. Unlike the impulsive energy of Aries, Sun in Taurus is slow, steady, and purposeful. It represents the "Builder" archetype—someone who takes the raw potential of Aries and gives it form, structure, and value.

Individuals with the Sun in Taurus are practical, reliable, and deeply connected to the material world. They value security above all else and have a natural talent for wealth accumulation and preservation. However, the Sun's ego here can manifest as stubbornness and resistance to change.
