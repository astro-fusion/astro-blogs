# Sun in Sagittarius: The Righteous Philosopher (Dhanu Rashi)

## Introduction

When the Sun enters Sagittarius (Dhanu Rashi), the light of the soul meets the wisdom of Jupiter. This is the placement of the "Rishi" or the wise teacher. The Sun feels comfortable here in this friendly fire sign. It is no longer about the personal ego (Leo) or the competitive spirit (Aries); it is about the higher mind, dharma, and the search for truth.

Individuals with the Sun in Sagittarius are eternal optimists. They are driven by a sense of purpose and justice. They are the archers of the zodiac—always aiming their arrow at a higher goal. They are straightforward, honest, and sometimes brutally blunt, but their intentions are usually pure.
