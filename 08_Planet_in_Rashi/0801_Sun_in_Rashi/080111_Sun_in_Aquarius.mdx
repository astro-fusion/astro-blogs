# Sun in Aquarius: The Visionary Rebel (Kumbha Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, the Sun in Aquarius (Kumbha Rashi) places the King in the house of the masses. Aquarius is co-ruled by Saturn (and Rahu), making it a sign of revolution, technology, and social systems. Here, the Sun's ego dissolves into the collective. It is no longer "I am," but "We are."

Individuals with this placement are the rebels, the scientists, and the humanitarians. They march to the beat of their own drum. They are often misunderstood because they live in the future. They value freedom and equality above all else, often challenging authority—which is ironic, as the Sun represents authority.
