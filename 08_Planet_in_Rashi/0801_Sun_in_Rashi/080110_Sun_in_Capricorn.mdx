# Sun in Capricorn: The Ambitious Architect (Makara Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, the Sun enters the domain of its enemy, Saturn, in Capricorn (Makara Rashi). However, unlike the chaotic enmity of Mars/Saturn, the Sun/Saturn relationship here is about **duty**. The King (Sun) enters the workplace of the servant (Saturn). The ego is suppressed for the sake of long-term achievement.

Individuals with the Sun in Capricorn are the CEOs, the builders, and the stoics of the zodiac. They are not interested in flash or drama; they are interested in results. They are disciplined, organized, and endlessly ambitious. Their light shines coldest, but it endures the longest.
