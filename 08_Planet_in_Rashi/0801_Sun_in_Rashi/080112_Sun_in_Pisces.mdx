# Sun in Pisces: The Spiritual Healer (Meena Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, the journey of the Sun concludes in Pisces (Meena Rashi). This is the 12th sign, representing dissolution, moksha (liberation), and the subconscious. It is a friendly sign for the Sun, ruled by Jupiter. Here, the Sun's ego dissolves completely into the ocean of universal consciousness.

Individuals with the Sun in Pisces are the dreamers, the mystics, and the healers of the zodiac. They live in two worlds: the material and the spiritual. They are deeply intuitive, compassionate, and artistic. However, the lack of a strong ego boundary can make them susceptible to escapism and deception.

## FAQs

**1. Is Sun in Pisces weak?**
It is not weak, but it is "diffused." It lacks the concentrated focal point of Aries or Leo. It shines everywhere rather than in one spot.

**2. Are Pisces Suns psychic?**
Almost always. Their gut feelings are usually right. They can sense danger or deception before it happens.

**3. Do they marry late?**
Often, because they are waiting for a "soul connection" and refuse to settle for a mundane marriage. Or they marry early and realize it was an illusion.
