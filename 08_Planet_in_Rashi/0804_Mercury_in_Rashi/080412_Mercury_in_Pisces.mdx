# Mercury in Pisces: The Intuitive Poet (Meena Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, Mercury is **debilitated** (Neecha) in Pisces. Mercury is the planet of dry logic, details, and discrimination. Pisces is the sign of boundless ocean, dreams, and oneness. Logic drowns in the ocean. The boundary between fact and fiction blurs.

However, debilitation does not mean stupidity. It means the planet works *differently*. Individuals with Mercury in Pisces are the **poets**, the **psychics**, and the **visionaries**. They don't think in straight lines; they think in swirls. They may suck at balancing a checkbook, but they can write a symphony that makes you weep.

### 4. Health and Vitality
Pisces rules the feet. Mercury rules the nerves.
