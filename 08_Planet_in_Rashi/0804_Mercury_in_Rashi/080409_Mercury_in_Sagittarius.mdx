# Mercury in Sagittarius: The Philosophical Wanderer (Dhanu Rashi)

## Introduction

In Vedic Astrology, Mercury in Sagittarius (Dhanu Rashi) places the detail-oriented planet in the expansive sign of Jupiter. This is considered a **detrimental** placement because Mercury deals with facts and details, while Sagittarius deals with faith and the big picture. The result is a mind that often misses the trees for the forest.

Individuals with Mercury in Sagittarius are brilliant philosophers, teachers, and storytellers. They are optimistic and honest—often too honest. They lack tact. They are interested in the *meaning* of life, not the grocery list. They are lifelong learners who want to understand everything.
