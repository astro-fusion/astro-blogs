In love, they are looking for stability, not drama. They are loyal and faithful partners who take their commitments seriously. However, they can be possessive and treat their partner like an "asset."

### Prediction:Career:General
**Rating: 4/5**
You are the definition of "slow and steady wins the race," building your career brick by brick with unwavering focus. You are highly respected for your reliability and practical wisdom, often becoming the anchor of your organization. While you may resist new technologies or rapid changes in the workplace, your consistent output ensures long-term job security.

### Prediction:Finance:Income
**Rating: 5/5**
You have a natural talent for accumulating wealth because you understand the power of saving and compound interest better than anyone. Money comes to you through traditional avenues, real estate, or long-term investments rather than get-rich-quick schemes. You are terrified of financial instability, which motivates you to build a substantial nest egg that guarantees comfort in old age.

### Prediction:Finance:Expenses
**Rating: 4/5**
You are distinctively frugal, often thinking twice before spending even a small amount on something you deem unnecessary. When you do spend, it is always on high-quality items that will last a lifetime, as you despise the "throwaway culture." You may struggle to enjoy your money, hoarding it for a future rainy day that may never come.

### Prediction:Relationships:Romantic
**Rating: 4/5**
You offer a rock-solid foundation for a partner, providing loyalty, fidelity, and material comfort that is unmatched. You take marriage vows very seriously and will work through difficulties rather than giving up, aiming for a lifelong union. However, your partner may find you emotionally rigid or overly focused on the practical side of life, missing the spark of spontaneous romance.

### Prediction:Relationships:Family
**Rating: 5/5**
You are the responsible pillar of your family, often taking care of the family finances or managing the ancestral property. You value family traditions and stability, ensuring that your home is a secure fortress for your loved ones. You may be strict with children regarding money and discipline, teaching them the value of hard work early on.

### Prediction:Health:Physical
**Rating: 4/5**
You generally possess a strong, enduring constitution that allows you to work long hours without fatigue. However, your metabolism may be sluggish, leading to weight gain if you are sedentary, and you are prone to stiffness in the neck and shoulders. Regular, moderate exercise is essential to keep your earth energy from becoming stagnant.

### Prediction:Health:Mental
**Rating: 4/5**
You are mentally grounded and stable, rarely suffering from the anxiety or erratic thoughts that plague air signs. Your primary source of stress is financial insecurity; as long as your bank account is healthy, your mind is at peace. You can prone to depression or "heaviness" if you feel your security is threatened or if you are stuck in a rut.

### Prediction:Education:Academic
**Rating: 3/5**
You learn slowly but thoroughly, preferring to master one subject completely before moving on to the next. You excel in practical subjects like business, finance, and agriculture where the knowledge has a tangible application. You may struggle in fast-paced or abstract academic environments, needing time to digest information fully.

### Prediction:Travel:Domestic
**Rating: 3/5**
You travel for relaxation and comfort, often returning to the same favorite spots year after year rather than exploring new places. You dislike the unpredictability of travel and will plan every detail to ensure you are not inconvenienced. Camping or roughing it is not for you; you need a comfortable bed and good food.

### Prediction:Travel:Foreign
**Rating: 3/5**
Foreign travel is viewed as an investment; you go if it offers good value or a specific cultural experience you desire. You are cautious abroad, sticking to safe areas and well-known tourist routes rather than going off the beaten path. You enjoy the art, architecture, and cuisine of other cultures but are always happy to return to the comfort of your own home.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Practice
**Rating: 3/5**
Your spirituality is grounded and ritualistic, often involving tangible offerings like flowers, food, or incense. You see God in the stability of nature and practicing patience is your primary spiritual discipline. You are not drawn to abstract mysticism but rather to a faith that provides a moral code and structure for living.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Karma
**Rating: 4/5**
Your karma involves the proper stewardship of material resources and learning that true security comes from within, not from your bank balance. You are here to build something lasting that benefits future generations. The lesson is to release your tight grip on possessions and trust in the abundance of the universe.
