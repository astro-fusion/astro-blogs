**Rating: 5/5**
You are the ultimate professional, known for your immaculate work ethic and ability to spot errors that everyone else misses. You thrive in roles that require high levels of precision and organization, often becoming the indispensable "fixer" in your office. However, your tendency to get bogged down in details can make you slow, and you may struggle to delegate because you believe no one else can do it perfectly.

### Prediction:Finance:Income
**Rating: 4/5**
Your income is stable and comes from your specialized skills or service-oriented work. You are cautious with money, budgeting down to the last cent and rarely overspending. Wealth accumulates through your ability to find efficiencies and cut waste, rather than through risky speculation.

### Prediction:Finance:Expenses
**Rating: 4/5**
You are a smart shopper who compares prices and reads reviews before buying anything. Your expenses are largely focused on health, wellness, and practical tools that improve your efficiency. You hate wasting money on low-quality items and will often repair things rather than replacing them.

### Prediction:Relationships:Romantic
**Rating: 3/5**
You approach relationships with a checklist of requirements, analyzing potential partners for compatibility and flaws. While you are a devoted and helpful partner, your critical nature can kill the romance if you are not careful. You need a partner who appreciates your acts of service and doesn't take your worry as personal criticism.

### Prediction:Relationships:Family
**Rating: 4/5**
You are the responsible family member who organizes the gatherings and ensures everyone takes their medicine. You may worry excessively about the health and safety of your relatives, often taking on the role of caretaker. Your home is likely clean and organized, but it may lack a relaxed, cozy atmosphere due to your high standards.

### Prediction:Health:Physical
**Rating: 3/5**
Your physical health is generally good because you are health-conscious, but your nervous system is sensitive to stress. You are prone to digestive issues like constipation or IBS, which flare up when you are anxious or overworked. Maintaining a strict routine for eating and sleeping is crucial for your well-being.

### Prediction:Health:Mental
**Rating: 2/5**
You suffer from high anxiety and a relentless inner critic that tells you nothing you do is ever good enough. You can become obsessed with details or hygiene, potentially developing OCD-like tendencies if unchecked. Learning to accept "good enough" is the key to your mental peace.

### Prediction:Education:Academic
**Rating: 5/5**
You are a brilliant student who excels in technical subjects, languages, and sciences where precision is rewarded. You take meticulous notes and study hard, often outperforming your peers through sheer effort. However, exam anxiety can be a major hurdle for you, causing you to blank out even when you know the material.

### Prediction:Travel:Domestic
**Rating: 3/5**
You plan your trips carefully, often creating detailed itineraries to ensure you don't miss anything. You prefer clean, safe, and organized destinations, avoiding places that seem chaotic or unsanitary. You travel to learn or for health retreats rather than for wild adventure.

### Prediction:Travel:Foreign
**Rating: 3/5**
Foreign travel can cause you anxiety about food safety, hygiene, or getting lost in an unfamiliar place. You are likely to research your destination thoroughly and pack a comprehensive medical kit just in case. When you do relax, you enjoy exploring the history and craftsmanship of other cultures.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Practice
**Rating: 3/5**
Your spirituality is practical and service-oriented (Karma Yoga); you feel closest to God when you are helping others or bringing order to chaos. You prefer rituals that are precise and orderly, finding comfort in the repetition of mantras or structured prayer. You may be skeptical of mystical claims that cannot be proven or analyzed.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Karma
**Rating: 4/5**
Your karma is to learn the perfection of imperfection. You are here to serve humanity with your skills, but also to learn compassion for the flaws in yourself and others. The lesson is that the world doesn't need to be perfect to be beautiful.
