### Prediction:Career:General
**Rating: 5/5**
You are a reliable and steady worker who is valued for your consistent output and calm under pressure. Your artistic eye and sense of quality make you excellent in design or luxury industries where taste is paramount. While you may lack the speed of fire signs, your persistence ensures you always finish what you start with high quality.

### Prediction:Finance:Income
**Rating: 5/5**
You have a natural "Dhana Yoga" (wealth combination) because Venus is strong in the house of resources. Money tends to come to you easily, often through investments, real estate, or careers in beauty and finance. You rarely face poverty because you have a deep respect for money and know how to manage it wisely.

### Prediction:Finance:Expenses
**Rating: 3/5**
You love the finer things in life and will readily spend significant amounts on luxury items, good food, and comfort. While you are generally good with money, your desire for high-quality brands and expensive indulgences can drain your wallet. You believe in "buy it once, buy it right," preferring durability over cheap trends.

### Prediction:Relationships:Romantic
**Rating: 5/5**
You are a devoted lover who offers immense stability, sensuality, and loyalty to your chosen partner. Romance for you involves tangible expressions of love like candlelit dinners, soft blankets, and physical closeness.

### Prediction:Relationships:Family
**Rating: 5/5**
You are the rock of your family, providing emotional and financial stability for everyone around you. You love family gatherings, especially those centered around holidays and feasts, where you can play the gracious host.

### Prediction:Health:Physical
**Rating: 4/5**
You generally possess a strong, earthy constitution and good vitality, rarely falling ill with minor bugs.

Throat issues are your weak spot, so you must protect your voice and thyroid health.

### Prediction:Health:Mental
**Rating: 5/5**
You are mentally grounded and stable, rarely suffering from the anxiety or erratic thoughts that plague other signs.

You dislike roughing it and will always ensure you have a comfortable bed and good meals wherever you go.

### Prediction:Travel:Foreign
**Rating: 4/5**
You enjoy visiting foreign countries to experience their culture, art, and especially their cuisine. Your travels are often planned well in advance to ensure maximum comfort and minimal surprise. You are likely to bring back beautiful, high-quality souvenirs that add to the aesthetic of your home.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Practice
**Rating: 3/5**
Your spirituality is grounded and tangible, often involving rituals that use flowers, incense, and music. You see the divine in the beauty of nature and the pleasures of the physical world rather than in abstract asceticism. Chanting or singing devotional songs (Bhajans) is a powerful spiritual path for you due to your strong throat center.

### Prediction:Spirituality:Karma
**Rating: 4/5**
Your karma involves the proper stewardship of resources and learning to find spiritual value in the material plane. You are here to understand that abundance is a divine blessing to be shared, not hoarded out of fear. The lesson is to cultivate non-attachment even while enjoying the beautiful things you possess.
