### 2. Is 5th Lord in 6th, 8th, or 12th bad?

### 3. Which planet is the best 5th Lord?
Jupiter is the natural Karaka (significator) of the 5th house. If Jupiter is the 5th Lord (for Leo or Scorpio ascendants) and is well placed, it is excellent. However, any planet can be good if it is a functional benefic for the chart.
