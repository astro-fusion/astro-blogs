## Introduction
In **Vedic Astrology**, the **8th House** (Randhra Bhava) is often feared as a "Dusthana" (evil house), but it is also the house of **Moksha** (liberation) and profound transformation. It governs:
*   **Longevity & Death**
*   **Sudden Events (Gains & Losses)**
*   **Occult & Mysticism**
*   **Inheritance & Other People's Money**
*   **Sexual Intimacy**

The **8th Lord** carries the energy of change. Wherever it sits, it brings an element of instability, mystery, and intensity. It forces you to look beneath the surface and often puts you through trials that lead to spiritual growth.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Is the 8th Lord always bad?
No. While it brings challenges, it is the planet of **transformation**. It destroys the old to make way for the new. It gives depth, research ability, and spiritual insight.

### 2. What is Vipareeta Raja Yoga?
When the 8th Lord sits in the 6th, 8th, or 12th house, it creates a "reversal of fortune." The negative energy of the house cancels out the negative energy of the lord, leading to success, often after a struggle or crisis.

### 3. How does 8th Lord in 5th House affect speculation?
