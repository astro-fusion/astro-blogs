## The Significance of the 10th Lord in Vedic Astrology

It is a critical sector that influences how others perceive you and your achievements. The 12th House, on the other hand, is associated with spirituality, self-undoing, and hidden matters. When the 10th Lord (the planet ruling the 10th House) occupies the 12th House, it brings together these two realms in a complex interplay.
