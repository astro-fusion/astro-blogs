## Keywords:

- Career and Wealth Astrology
- Financial Success Indicators
- Money Through Profession
- Vedic Astrology Wealth Combinations

## Summary:
The placement of 10th Lord in 2nd House creates a powerful wealth-building combination where career success directly translates into financial prosperity. This placement indicates individuals who earn substantial money through their profession and often develop multiple income streams related to their expertise.

## Understanding the 10th Lord in Vedic Astrology

The 10th Lord represents our *Karma* (actions), public status, and professional achievements. The 2nd House represents *Dhana* (wealth), *Kutumba* (family), *Vani* (speech), and *Bhojana* (food).

When the 10th Lord is placed in the 2nd House, it creates a powerful **Dhana Yoga** (Wealth Yoga). This placement indicates that the native's professional actions (10th House) are directly channeled into accumulating resources and wealth (2nd House).

## Classical Interpretation (BPHS)

The *Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra* states:

> **"If the 10th Lord is in the 2nd House, the native will be wealthy, virtuous, honored by the king, charitable, and will enjoy happiness from father and relatives."**

### Decoding the Shloka:
1.  **Wealthy**: The primary result is wealth. The career is lucrative, and the native has the ability to retain earnings.
2.  **Virtuous & Charitable**: Success comes through ethical means. The native understands the value of money and is willing to share it for good causes.
3.  **Honored by the King**: In modern terms, this means recognition from the government, top management, or high-ranking officials.
4.  **Happiness from Father**: The 10th house is also a secondary house for the father (being 7th from the 4th, or simply as the house of authority). Its lord in the 2nd (family) strengthens the bond and support from the father.

-   **Family Business**: The 2nd house represents family lineage. The 10th Lord here strongly indicates joining or expanding a family business.
-   **Voice as a Career**: Since the 2nd house rules speech (*Vani*), the profession often involves speaking, singing, consulting, or teaching.
